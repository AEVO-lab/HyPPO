-- SuperGeneTrees --This program has two features: (1) given a set of k gene trees (with possibly overlapping genes) and a species tree S, find and output a supergenetree minimizing reconciliation with S. (-m sgt)(2) given a single gene tree G with marked nodes and a species tree S, find and output a subtree triplet-respecting historyfor G minimizing reconciliation. (-m sub)For (1), we assume that the given gene trees are compatible.  Otherwise, the behavior of the programis unpredictable (it will probably output NULL, but this hasn't been checked).For (2), we assume that the marked nodes partition the leaves of G.  That is, every leaf has a markedancestor (possibly itself) and no marked node has a marked ancestor.There is an optional flag (-p) which, when set, forces the Duplication/Speciation nodes of the input tree to be preserved (Dup/Spec are inferred according to most parsimonious reconciliation).Example calls:Make a supertree from two input gene trees.> SuperGeneTree -gn "((A1__A, C1__C),(B1__B, (C2__C,D2__D)));((B2__B,D3__D),(B1__B,C3__C));" -sn "((A,B),(C,D))"
Same as above except dup/spec have to be preserved> SuperGeneTree -p -gn "((A1__A, C1__C),(B1__B, (C2__C,D2__D)));((B2__B,D3__D),(B1__B,C3__C));" -sn "((A,B),(C,D))"Apply subtree triplet-repspecting correction (m stands for marked)> SuperGeneTree -m sub -sn "(((A,B),C), (D,E));" -gn "(((A1__A, B1__B)m,C1__Cm), ((D1__D,E1__E),(((A2__A,B2__B),C2__C), (D2__D,E2__E)))m);"-- Input format --All trees must be in Newick format.Every leaf of the gene tree(s) must be mapped to a leaf of the species tree.The leaf label is used, and must have the format [GENE_NAME]__[SPECIES_NAME](notice the double-underscore).For super gene trees, GENE_NAME is extremely important.  Two genes with the same GENE_NAME are consideredthe same gene, which has a bearing in "sgt" mode.In "sub" mode, the label of marked nodes must end with "m" (see examples above).

-- Command line arguments ---m [mode] : must be one of "sgt" (default) for super gene tree, or "sub" for subtree triplet-respecting correction.
-s [filename] : name of the file containing the species tree newick
-sn [species newick]: newick string of the species tree
[One of -s or -sn must be specified.  If both are, -s takes precedence]

-g [filename] : name of the file containing the gene tree(s).  If many trees, each must be separated by a semi colon ";".  The label of marked nodes must end with "m" (see examples above).
-gn [gene newick] : newick string of the gene tree(s).  If many trees, each must be separated by a semi colon ";".  The label of marked nodes must end with "m" (see examples above).
[One of -g or -gn must be specified.  If both are, -g takes precedence]
-pAdd to parameters to force Duplication/Speciation preservation.
